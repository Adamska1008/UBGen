# UBGen

ðŸŒŸUBGenðŸŒŸ is an automated UB program genertor for C. Given a valid C program, UBGen can mutate it to generate programs containing undefined behaviors. For each of the generated UB program, it only contains one kind of undefined behavior at one program location.

UBGen is designed in our research paper **"UBfuzz: Finding Bugs in Sanitizer Implementations" (ASPLOS 2024)**, where UBGen is the program generator for UBfuzz. For the full evaluation of UBfuzz, please find the artifact as stated in the paper.

## Quick Start

**Compile dynamic analyzer for analyzing C source code:**
Please make sure that `LLVM>=18` is installed.
```shell
./build.sh
```

**Install necessary Python packages:**
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The generator is `ubgen.py`. Each time you run it, `ubgen.py` generates more than one UB programs based on one Csmith-generated program.

Note that, *for the first run* of `ubgen.py`, it will download and install `Csmith` under the same directory.

For example, the following code will generate programs containing buffer-overflow and all the generated UB programs are saved into `./mutants`:

```shell
./ubgen.py --ub buffer-overflow --out ./mutants
```

Alternatively, you can use an integer index to specify the UB. For example, the above command is equivalent to 
```shell
./ubgen.py --ub 0 --out ./mutants
```

By default, all programs are mutated from csmith. If you want to specify your own seed C file, try `--seed` as follows
```shell
./ubgen.py --ub 0 --out ./mutants --seed seed.c
```
The seed file `seed.c` is a valid C file without undefined behaviors. Note that, UBGen will not insert UB in the `main()` function. Therefore, please make sure
that there are other functions in your seed file.

You can use `./ubgen --help` to find detailed help information.

Suppose there are generated programs under `./mutants/` and one of the file is `./mutants/mutated_0_tmp6a83k7sn.c`. All generated files of the same prefix are from the same seed Csmith program.
For example, `./mutants/mutated_1_tmp6a83k7sn.c` would be another UB program from the same seed. To compile the generated UB program, you need to include the path the Csmith header files `./csmith_install/include/csmith-2.3.0`:
```shell
gcc -I./csmith_install/include/csmith-2.3.0 -fsanitize=address -g -w ./mutants/mutated_0_tmp6a83k7sn.c -o test.out
```
Executing `./test.out` would normally cause sanitizer warning as such
```shell
